      "Answer: You already did it.  You defined a class.  It's a class that has one method, `__init__`.  The `__init__` method is automatically called for each instance of the class when it's created.  It's a common idiom in Python to have the first line of an `__init__` method be `super(class_name,self).__init__()`.  This calls the `__init__` method of the parent class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment: Note that you don't have to call `super` in the class definition, but you will have to if you create subclasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Your class definition is perfectly fine, though it would be more idiomatic to define the `__init__` method without the `self` argument:\n",

      "        self.cents = cents\n",
      "\\end{code}\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you want to add a method to the class that can be used from outside the class, you'd add it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\begin{code}\n",
      "class Money:\n",
      "    def __init__(dollars, cents):\n",
      "        self.dollars = dollars\n",
      "        self.cents = cents\n",
      "\n",

      "        return str(self.dollars) + ' dollars and ' + str(self.cents) + ' cents'\n",
      "\\end{code}\n",
      "\n",
      "and then you can use it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\begin{code}\n",
      ">>> m = Money(1, 23)\n",
